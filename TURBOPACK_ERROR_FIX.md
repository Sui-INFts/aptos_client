# Turbopack Runtime Error Fix (The Annoying One)

## The Error That Drove Me Crazy

```
Error: Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'
```

This error is the bane of my existence. It happens when Next.js's Turbopack bundler gets confused and creates corrupted build files. Super annoying.

## Quick Fix (The Easy Way)

### Use My Fix Script
```bash
cd /Users/user/Cursor/Infts_project/aptos_client
./fix-turbopack-error.sh
```

### Manual Fix (The Hard Way)
```bash
# 1. Stop Next.js processes (kill them all)
pkill -f "next"

# 2. Remove corrupted build files (nuclear option)
rm -rf .next

# 3. Clear cache (get rid of the garbage)
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# 4. Reinstall dependencies (fresh start)
pnpm install

# 5. Start development server (hope it works)
pnpm run dev
```

## What Causes This Nightmare

### Common Causes
1. **Corrupted Build Cache** - The `.next` directory has corrupted files (happens way too often)
2. **Turbopack Issues** - Next.js 15+ Turbopack bundler problems (still buggy)
3. **Cache Conflicts** - Node modules cache conflicts (classic)
4. **Incomplete Builds** - Interrupted build processes (thanks, crashes)
5. **Version Conflicts** - Package version mismatches (dependency hell)

### When It Happens (The Usual Suspects)
- After updating Next.js (every time)
- After switching branches (git is evil)
- After system crashes during build (thanks, macOS)
- After package updates (pnpm update strikes again)
- After long development sessions (when you're in the zone)

## Prevention Tips (Learn From My Mistakes)

### Best Practices
1. **Regular Cleanups** - Run `rm -rf .next` before major changes
2. **Stable Dependencies** - Don't update everything at once
3. **Clean Installs** - Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in production
4. **Backup Working States** - Commit when things work (duh)
5. **Use the Fix Script** - Keep `fix-turbopack-error.sh` handy

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Before starting work
rm -rf .next
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# When things break (and they will)
./fix-turbopack-error.sh

# For production builds
rm -rf .next
pnpm run build
```

## The Fix Script I Created

I got tired of typing the same commands over and over, so I made a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# fix-turbopack-error.sh

echo "🔧 Fixing Turbopack errors..."

# Kill Next.js processes
echo "🛑 Stopping Next.js processes..."
pkill -f "next" || true

# Remove corrupted build files
echo "🗑️ Removing corrupted build files..."
rm -rf .next

# Clear cache
echo "🧹 Clearing cache..."
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Reinstall dependencies
echo "📦 Reinstalling dependencies..."
pnpm install

# Start development server
echo "🚀 Starting development server..."
pnpm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting (When the Fix Doesn't Work)

### If the Script Fails
1. **Check permissions** - Make sure the script is executable
2. **Manual steps** - Run each command individually
3. **Check for locks** - Look for `.pnpm-lock.yaml` issues
4. **Restart terminal** - Sometimes the shell is the problem
5. **Check Node version** - Make sure you're using the right version

### Advanced Debugging
```bash
# Check what's running
ps aux | grep next

# Check for lock files
ls -la | grep lock

# Check Node version
node --version
pnpm --version

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3000
```

## Alternative Solutions (When All Else Fails)

### Option 1: Disable Turbopack
```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  // Remove or comment out experimental.turbo
  // experimental: {
  //   turbo: {
  //     enabled: true,
  //   },
  // },
};
```

### Option 2: Use Webpack Instead
```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config) => {
    // Custom webpack config
    return config;
  },
};
```

### Option 3: Downgrade Next.js
```bash
# If Turbopack is too buggy
pnpm add next@14
```

## The Root Cause (My Theory)

Turbopack is still experimental and has issues with:
- **File watching** - Sometimes misses changes
- **Cache invalidation** - Doesn't clear properly
- **Module resolution** - Gets confused with imports
- **Build artifacts** - Creates corrupted files

## When to Use Each Fix

### Use the Script When:
- ✅ Build fails with Turbopack errors
- ✅ Development server won't start
- ✅ Hot reload stops working
- ✅ Random module not found errors

### Use Manual Steps When:
- ✅ Script doesn't work
- ✅ Need to debug specific issues
- ✅ Want to understand what's happening
- ✅ Script has permission issues

### Use Alternative Solutions When:
- ✅ Turbopack is consistently problematic
- ✅ Need stable builds for production
- ✅ Working on a team (consistency matters)
- ✅ Turbopack features aren't needed

## My Experience (The Real Talk)

I've had this error probably 20+ times. It's frustrating, but the fix script makes it bearable. The key is to not panic and just run the script. It usually works.

**Pro tip**: Keep the script in your project root and make it executable with `chmod +x fix-turbopack-error.sh`. You'll thank me later.

## Final Thoughts

Turbopack is cool when it works, but it's still buggy. The fix script is your friend. Use it liberally. Don't be afraid to nuke the `.next` folder - it's not sacred.

*This error will probably be fixed in future Next.js versions, but until then, this is how I deal with it.*
