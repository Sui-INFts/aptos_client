## Environment Setup (What You Need)

Required environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_API_KEY=your_aptos_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_IO_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY=your_io_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODIT_API_KEY=your_nodit_key
```

## Development Workflow (How I Work)

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo** - Get the code
2. **Install dependencies** - `pnpm install`
3. **Set up environment** - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. **Start development** - `pnpm run dev`

### Common Tasks
- **Build the project** - `pnpm run build`
- **Run linting** - `pnpm run lint`
- **Fix build issues** - `./fix-build.sh`
- **Clear cache** - `rm -rf .next`

## Troubleshooting (When Things Break)

### Build Issues
- **TURBOPACK_ERROR_FIX.md** - Fix for Turbopack runtime errors
- **BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Complete build troubleshooting guide
- **COMPREHENSIVE_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - All the fixes I've applied

### Common Problems
- **ENOENT errors** - Missing build manifest files
- **Address formatting** - Hex character validation issues
- **SBT status** - Contract interaction problems
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Layout issues on small screens

## Updates & Changes (What I've Done)

### Recent Updates
- **SBT_MINTING_UPDATE.md** - Permanent image system and fallback
- **MOBILE_RESPONSIVE.md** - Mobile-first responsive design
- **ACTION_WIDGETS_UPDATE.md** - Moved widgets to top of dashboard
- **SWAP_WIDGET_UPDATE.md** - Custom swap widget with no double auth

### Design Changes
- **Removed debug components** - Cleaned up the dashboard
- **Improved SBT card design** - Consistent with main dashboard
- **Added documentation link** - INFT Protocol docs on home page
- **Enhanced mobile experience** - Better touch interactions

## Architecture Decisions (Why I Did It This Way)

### SBT Gating System
- **Why**: Creates incentive for users to mint SBTs
- **How**: Dashboard features only available after minting
- **Result**: Higher SBT adoption and user engagement

### Permanent Image System
- **Why**: Users can always mint, even if Nodit fails
- **How**: Fallback to permanent image stored in assets
- **Result**: 100% reliability for SBT minting

### Widget Layout
- **Why**: Better UX - widgets appear where users expect
- **How**: Moved widgets to top of dashboard
- **Result**: Immediate visibility and better user flow

### Mobile-First Design
- **Why**: Most users access from mobile devices
- **How**: Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions
- **Result**: Great experience on all devices

## Best Practices (What I Learned)

### Development
1. **Always have fallbacks** - Things will break
2. **Test on mobile** - Touch interactions are different
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Users need clear feedback
4. **Use TypeScript** - Catch errors before runtime
5. **Keep documentation updated** - Future you will thank you

### User Experience
1. **Put important content at top** - Users expect immediate results
2. **Avoid double authentication** - Users hate connecting twice
3. **Make toggles intuitive** - Show/hide should be obvious
4. **Provide clear feedback** - Users need to know what's happening
5. **Optimize for performance** - Fast loading and smooth interactions

## The Tech Stack (What I Used)

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library for consistent design

### Blockchain
- **Aptos** - Move smart contracts
- **@aptos-labs/ts-sdk** - TypeScript SDK for Aptos
- **@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react** - Wallet connection

### AI & Storage
- **IO Intelligence** - AI models and chat functionality
- **Nodit** - Decentralized image storage
- **React Query** - Data fetching and caching

### Development Tools
- **pnpm** - Fast package manager
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Turbopack** - Fast bundler (when it works)
